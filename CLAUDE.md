This file provides guidance for AI assistance with the ed-ai-sessions repository, a research project on AI-assisted preparation for tutoring and academic support sessions.

## Repository Purpose

This repository develops and evaluates **AI-powered tools that help tutors and academic support professionals prepare for sessions** more effectively. The project focuses on the preparation phase, exploring how AI can enhance (not replace) educator expertise.

## Research Mission

**Core Question**: How can AI assist tutors in preparing for sessions in ways that enhance their effectiveness while maintaining professional agency and ethical standards?

**Key Principles**:

- **Enhancement over Replacement**: AI supports rather than replaces tutor expertise and judgment
- **Tutor Agency**: Professionals maintain control over preparation decisions and session approaches
- **Evidence-Based Design**: Tools grounded in research on tutoring, learning sciences, and educational AI
- **Ethical Integration**: Privacy-respecting, transparent AI assistance that serves educational goals

## Project Scope

### What This Project Addresses

- Analyzing student work to identify learning challenges
- Generating relevant practice materials and examples
- Suggesting evidence-based pedagogical strategies
- Streamlining administrative preparation tasks
- Documenting preparation decisions

### What This Project Does NOT Address

- Real-time AI assistance during tutoring sessions
- Automated grading or assessment
- Student-facing AI tools without tutor mediation
- Replacement of tutor decision-making

## Research Approach

### Methodology

This project employs **design-based research**:

1. **Literature Review**: Synthesize research on tutoring and AI in education
2. **Needs Assessment**: Interview tutors about current preparation practices
3. **Prototype Development**: Build and test AI-assisted tools
4. **Evaluation**: User studies and learning outcome analysis
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback and findings

### Theoretical Foundations

Drawing from:

- **Learning Sciences**: How students learn and how tutoring supports learning
- **Educational AI**: Design principles for AI in educational contexts
- **Tutoring Research**: Evidence on effective tutoring practices
- **AI Ethics**: Privacy, agency, transparency, and fairness

### Target Users

- Individual tutors in writing centers and language labs
- Peer tutors in undergraduate/graduate programs
- Academic support professionals
- Faculty offering office hours

## Documentation Standards

When working with this repository:

- Use clear, accessible language appropriate for interdisciplinary audiences
- Cite sources appropriately (link to [AI-Ed Hub bibliography](https://ai-praxis.github.io/ed-ai) when relevant)
- Follow Quarto markdown conventions for documentation
- Maintain consistent organization within established directory structure
- Add carriage returns between headers and body text, and between text and lists

## Collaboration

This project welcomes collaboration from:

- Tutoring center staff and directors
- Researchers studying tutoring or educational AI
- Developers interested in educational tool design
- Students and practitioners interested in AI-enhanced academic support

When adding content, consider how it might be useful to these diverse stakeholders.

## Relationship to AI-Ed Hub

This project is part of the [AI-PRAXIS](https://github.com/ai-praxis) organization. For general background on AI in higher education, including literature reviews, funding resources, and broader context, see the [AI-Ed Research Hub](https://ai-praxis.github.io/ed-ai).

The hub provides:

- General AI-in-education literature and research
- Funding strategies and opportunities
- Reusable templates and frameworks
- Broader theoretical foundations

This spoke project builds on that foundation with **project-specific focus on tutoring session preparation**.

## Technical Environment

This repository uses:

- **Nix flakes** for reproducible development environments
- **Quarto** for documentation and website generation
- **R and Python** for data analysis and visualization
- **Git** for version control and collaboration

## AI Assistance Guidelines

When using AI tools (like Claude Code) with this repository:

- Prioritize accuracy and evidence-based claims over speculation
- Maintain academic rigor in documentation
- Consider ethical implications of proposed AI tools for tutoring
- Focus specifically on the **session preparation** context (not real-time assistance)
- Think critically about enhancing vs. replacing tutor expertise
- Keep documentation clear and accessible
- Consider practical constraints of real tutoring environments

## Expected Outcomes

This project should produce:

1. **Research Publications**: Findings on AI-assisted preparation in tutoring contexts
2. **Open-source Prototypes**: Tools that tutoring programs can adapt
3. **Best Practice Guidelines**: Recommendations for ethical, effective implementation
4. **Training Materials**: Resources for onboarding tutors to AI-assisted workflows
5. **Design Insights**: Lessons learned for educational AI tool development

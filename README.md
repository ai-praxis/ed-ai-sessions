# AI Session Preparation Project

> Research and development of AI-powered tools to enhance tutoring and academic support session preparation

## Overview

The **AI Session Preparation Project** (ed-ai-sessions) develops and evaluates AI-assisted tools that help tutors and academic support professionals prepare for individual and group sessions more effectively.

Rather than replacing human expertise, this project explores how AI can enhance preparation workflows by analyzing student work, generating relevant materials, suggesting pedagogical approaches, and streamlining administrative tasks.

## Philosophy

This project emphasizes:

- **Enhancement over replacement**: AI supports rather than replaces tutor expertise
- **Tutor agency**: Professionals maintain control over preparation and session decisions
- **Evidence-based design**: Tools grounded in research on tutoring and learning sciences
- **Ethical integration**: Privacy-respecting, transparent AI assistance

## Research Approach

This project employs **design-based research methodology**:

1. Literature review and needs assessment
2. Prototype development with tutor input
3. Pilot testing in tutoring programs
4. Evaluation through user studies
5. Iterative refinement based on findings

## Target Users

- Individual tutors in writing centers and language labs
- Peer tutors in undergraduate/graduate programs
- Academic support professionals
- Faculty offering office hours and consultations

## Current Status

This project is in the **planning and design phase**. See the [Project Logs](logs/) for development updates.
